I am an undergraduate senior at Vassar College studying Computer Science and Astronomy. I have a background in applied machine learning, game design, data science, and I have been dabbling in graphics programming. My previous work involved implementing AI solutions to streamline employee workflows for a informational technology company. My past research includes fine-tuning NER Models to work better on mixed-domain corpora, and big data analysis of the magnetohydrodynamics of a galactic simulation. In my work I try to focus on understanding systems from first principles rather than accepting them as black boxes.

This website is a landing page describing who I am, and what I have been working on. Look at my [portfolio page](https://samzombie.github.io/portfolio/) to see what I have been building!
